# SudokuSolver
Rather than using backtracking, this "pencils" in all options in each cell. From there it will, solve it in the way a human would by choosing obvious answers and updating "pencil" options in the remaining cells. This does not always finish the board, but rather fills in all cells that can be filled in without backtracking.

This project aims to optimize the brute backtracking method of solving sudoku, by mimicing a human's logical approach.
