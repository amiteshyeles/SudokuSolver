# SudokuSolver
Rather than using backtracking, this "pencils" in all options in each cell. From there it will, solve it in the way a human would by choosing obvious answers and updating "pencil" options in the remaining cells. This does not finish the board, but rather fills in all cells that can be filled in without backtracking.
